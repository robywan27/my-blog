I am a software developer born in Milan and currently based in The Netherlands.

I have graduated with a MSc degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Polytechnic University of Milan.

My MSc thesis was done at TU Delft, it concerned the analysis of the political opinion in two specific scenarios on Twitter.

I have worked one year as a full-stack web developer for a gaming company working with technologies such as PHP, Javascript.

In the last few months I have been interested in the topic of functional programming.
This lead me to a journey of
re-discovering the fundamentals of programming languages and computer science.

I have recently started attending meetups, conferences to meet and connect with fellow and seasoned developers.

I have decided to write a blog with my ruminations in the landscape of programming languages and software development.

My goals for the future
 - getting acquainted with a large number of programming languages to appreciate different approaches to solve problems
 - reading scientific articles and papers to become acquainted with academic topics such as formal methods, type theory, automated software testing, compilers
 - contribute to open source
 - dedicate more time for personal projects
 - keep learning new things
 - keep up to date with the technological advancements in the industry
