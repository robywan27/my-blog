This post will provide a brief overview of the programming language Haskell. One reason why Haskell is an apt language to study the concepts of functional programming is that unlike most, it is a pure functional language. This means that Haskell code is free from side effects and imperative structures. As we will see briefly, the language puts at disposal a framework to deal with side effects, or else it would not be of practical use in the real world. This post will touch the topics covered in the book by Hutton footnoteref:[hutton, http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html] and the edX MOOC footnote:[https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-functional-programming-delftx-fp101x-0].
