Heyo, I am Roberto. My greatest interests are programming languages and software engineering. I believe that both are complementary as well as beneficial to the construction of better software. The world runs on software, so we'd better write good software!

*Programming languages* are the tool that makes building software possible. As such, I think that as software developers we should deeply understand the fundamental principles underlying them. This provides a framework which makes it possible to appreciate the commonalities as well as the differences among languages, guiding you into making informed decisions on which language or language feature is best suited to solve a given problem.

*Software engineering* provides the toolbox of patterns, heuristics and best practices to create software systems that are more functional, reliable, maintanable, efficient and secure. No programming language can save an application from bad software practices. 

I also believe in *sharing and exchanging of knowledge and ideas* for building and maintaining a healthy and vibrant community of developers. I believe in open source as well as in any activity bringing together fellow developers (meetups, conferences, hackathons, ...).

Other than programming or discovering more on computer science, I enjoy playing the *guitar*. My favorite music style is rock, even though I have learned to become omnivorous and can pretty much listen to any kind of music, as long as I see an artistic touch in it.

I find *travelling* to be fascinating, in that it allows you to be confronted with different places, cultures and people. I think it is paramount to open your mind and to become a more tolerant person.

I like to *keep fit* but have no particular aspirations on becoming particularly athletic; I go to the gym and sometimes I run, cycle or swim.

I like *reading* on a variety of topics (technology or whatever) and watching *documentaries*.
