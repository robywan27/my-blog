Heyo, I am Roberto, and I am a software developer. My greatest interests are programming languages and software engineering. Learning different programming languages is not simply a matter of getting acquainted with different syntaxes, rather is wearing lenses, each one providing a different perspective on how to approach the solution to a problem. Software engineering provides the toolbox of patterns, heuristics and best practices to solve problems. I believe that a deep understanding of the principles underlying programming languages joined with the knowledge of software engineering best practices are essential for the growth of as a developer, and it is thus the goal I intend on pursuing.

I believe also that a software developer's journey is no one man's journey, rather is a collective experience with the community of developers. It is thus important to open up and reach out to the community by exchanging knowledge with fellow and more seasoned developers and contributing to the open source.

## Content of the blog
This blog contains some articles which are generic in topic and broad in scope, while others are technical in content. The technical articles often touch some basic but fundamental topics; while they may seem trivial and obvious it is my belief that developers shuold make sure to have solid conceptual foundations. As another note, these articles are meant for personal review and reference; while I certainly appreciate if they be of utility to others, I advise to take anything I say with a grain of salt, as the content may perhaps be inaccurate if not even mistaken. In any case these posts are not meant as a substitute of other more valuable resources (references to them will be included in my articles).
